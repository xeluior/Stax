Stax is a classic-style falling block puzzle game where the player aligns
randomly generated pieces to complete rows and earn points. The game controls
almost entirely with the keyboard D-Pad.

- Up to rotate the piece
- Left and Right to shift the piece
- Down to double the falling speed

The player can use Esc or Ctrl-C to quit the game at any time.

libsdl.org under the zlib license. It also makes use of Monogram available at
